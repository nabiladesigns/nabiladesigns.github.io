								<h3><strong>Streamlining web experience for a nonprofit art tour.</strong></h3>
								<p>The Cedars Open Studios website was being hosted on Wordpress which was confusing for board members to update. Additionally, the format felt better suited towards a blog than a non-profit tour landing page so it was confusing for the general public.</p>
								<p>Redesigning the web experience for the non-profit tour page in 2020 also meant creating a more interactive map page since, due to COVID-19, the artists were required to set up their installations outside and the tour was better navigated via guest’s own cars rather than taking public transit typically available during the tour.</p>
								<p>And the last challenge was designing a virtual tour page since some guests were high risk and simply would not feel comfortable coming in person to the tour. Adding a virtual tour concept with interviews and video would make the guest feel welcome to explore and learn about the Cedar’s artists.</p>

									<strong>New vs. Old</strong>
									<ul>
										<li>The new layout is cleaner and easier to navigate as the old layout used a template based on a blog format. Because of this, it would often direct users to click on “Recent Posts” which wasn’t often relevant to what the user needs.</li>
										<li>The old layout was only able to provide a list of artists that would be participating on the tour. The new layout allowed for there to be a highlight on each artist so users could learn more about them and would also be more interested in finding the tour stops associated with artists they found online.</li>
										<li>Due to the pandemic, we also needed to redesign the map page to be more interactive. The 2020 tour was more suited to driving than foot traffic and we wouldn’t print out physical maps to reduce cost and physical interaction. Because of this, we used an embedded Google Map to plot out tour stops. Users could click through the map and also look at images we uploaded associated with each tour stop. The online map was also able to be more accurate than paper maps printed before the tour as it could be updated even up to the day of the tour.</li>
										<li>The website had been on Wordpress for years and members of the board weren't able to edit it if the previous website volunteer was busy. The new website is hosted on Squarespace which is easier for board members to use.</li>
										<li>The website had an old year in the domain name which wasn't convenient since they were using the same domain year to year.</li>

								<h3 class="page">Step three: Try</h3>
								<p>
									This year with the global pandemic, Cedars Open Studios wanted to find new ways for the public to connect with artists, especially for individuals who may be high-risk. So we created a virtual tour concept with interviews of artists showing their studios in a video format. I created the template for those pages and uploaded videos onto pages when I received them. In addition, I did copywriting when needed to create engaging video descriptions.
								</p>
								<img src="../images/cos-cs-1.png">
								<img src="../images/cos-cs-2.png">
								<img src="../images/cos-cs-3.png">
								<img src="../images/cos-cs-4.png">
								<p>I set up two templates to get board member's opinion on which format felt more engaging for the virtual page.</p>
								<p>The version on the left would have the videos embedded directly on the page to make for easy transitions between videos. The layout felt similar to YouTube which increases familiarity.</p>
								<p>The version on the right has thumbnails which direct you to the artist page with the video embedded at the top of the page which gives users a more in-depth look into each individual artist. Also the format was similar to layouts on our own site so users would have a similar familiarity.</p>
								<p>I conducted a small study with board members and available artists totaling 7 people and the response was overwhelmingly clear that the left version was preferred. Participants felt it was more engaging and also noted that it looked better on mobile.</p>
								<p>After the layout was approved, I added descriptions to make the page more engaging and added content at the bottom of the artist pages to prompt users to explore the next artist.</p>

									This was my first website redesign before I truly understood what it meant to be a UX designer. While I do love how the website turned out, I would also like to learn how to create more interest on a page as the current design is pretty simple. It is functional and easy to navigate so I'm happy it serves it's purpose there. I'm still building my own personal style when it comes to UX design so for future projects, I hope to really acquire more understanding on how to execute a design with personal taste demonstrated. Overall, I throughly enjoyed working on this project especially since it allowed me to really get a feel for each individual artist's style.
