								<h3><strong>Streamlining web experience for a nonprofit art tour.</strong></h3>
								<p>The Cedars Open Studios website was being hosted on Wordpress which was confusing for board members to update. Additionally, the format felt better suited towards a blog than a non-profit tour landing page so it was confusing for the general public.</p>
								<p>Redesigning the web experience for the non-profit tour page in 2020 also meant creating a more interactive map page since, due to COVID-19, the artists were required to set up their installations outside and the tour was better navigated via guest’s own cars rather than taking public transit typically available during the tour.</p>
								<p>The last challenge was designing a virtual tour page since some guests were high-risk and simply would not feel comfortable touring in-person. Adding a virtual tour concept with interviews and videos would help guests feel welcome to explore and learn about the Cedar’s artists.</p>

											See my proposed layout in the following diagrams.
											This layout presents an easily navigable header bar with a clean and simple layout for the home page, which focuses on tour dates and other necessary information for users.
											The header invites a user to learn more about the tour with direct labeling.
											<br>
											<br>
											The old layout used a template based on a blog format.
											Because of this, it would often direct users to click on “Recent Posts” which wasn’t clearly relevant to what the user needs.
											The home page appeared cluttered.
											<i><strong>Note:</strong> As the old site has been permanently taken down, screenshots are unfortunately not available.</i>

										In addition to navigation and layout changes, the redesign included a switch to Squarespace, allowing members of the board to collaborate on the site and make small edits themselves.
										The website had historically been managed on Wordpress, and board members would have to request changes from a single volunteer maintainer, with updates depending significantly on his bandwidth.

									<strong>New vs. Old</strong>
									<ul>
										<li>The new layout is cleaner and easier to navigate as the old layout used a template based on a blog format. Because of this, it would often direct users to click on “Recent Posts” which wasn’t often relevant to what the user needs.</li>
										<li>The old layout was only able to provide a list of artists that would be participating on the tour. The new layout allowed for there to be a highlight on each artist so users could learn more about them and would also be more interested in finding the tour stops associated with artists they found online.</li>
										<li>Due to the pandemic, we also needed to redesign the map page to be more interactive. The 2020 tour was more suited to driving than foot traffic and we wouldn’t print out physical maps to reduce cost and physical interaction. Because of this, we used an embedded Google Map to plot out tour stops. Users could click through the map and also look at images we uploaded associated with each tour stop. The online map was also able to be more accurate than paper maps printed before the tour as it could be updated even up to the day of the tour.</li>
										<li>The website had been on Wordpress for years and members of the board weren't able to edit it if the previous website volunteer was busy. The new website is hosted on Squarespace which is easier for board members to use.</li>
										<li>The website had an old year in the domain name which wasn't convenient since they were using the same domain year to year.</li>

								<p>
									This year with the global pandemic, Cedars Open Studios wanted to find new ways for the public to connect with artists, especially for individuals who may be high-risk. We created a virtual tour concept with individual artist pages featuring interviews and studio showings as videos. I created the template for these pages, embedded the video content, and often wrote copy as-needed to create interesting video descriptions.
								</p>
								<div>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-8-xlarge col-8-large col-12-medium col-12-small col-12-xsmall">
											<div>

											</div>
										</div>
										<div class="col-4-xlarge col-4-large col-12-medium col-12-small col-12-xsmall">
											<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
												I set up two templates and solicited feedback from board members on which format felt more engaging for the virtual page.
											</p>
											<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
												The top version has videos embedded directly on the page to allow easy transitions between videos. The layout feels similar to YouTube and is intended to foster familiarity.
											</p>
											<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
												The bottom version has thumbnails which direct you to the artist page where the video is embedded at the top of the page, giving users a more in-depth look into each individual artist. This format feels familiar to layouts elsewhere on the Cedars Open Studios site.
											</p>
										</div>
									</div>
								</div>
								<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
									I conducted a small study with board members and available artists (totaling seven people), and the response was overwhelmingly in favor of the bottom version. Participants felt it was more engaging and also noted that it looked better on mobile.
								</p>
								<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
									After the layout was approved, I added short descriptions to each artist listing, making more information accessible to end users and allowing them to make more informed clicks on which artists were more interesting to them.
									To keep users engaged, each artist's page was updated to include the catalogue of artists at the bottom, prompting users to explore further.

								<p>
									This was my first website redesign before I truly understood what
									it meant to be a UX designer. While I do love how the website turned
									out with respect to simplicity, functionality, and navigability, there
									is certainly potential to experiment with design choices that make the
									website more fun, engaging, and different. I'm still building
									my own personal style when it comes to UX design, so for future projects,
									I hope to really acquire more understanding on how to execute a design
									with my personal tastes demonstrated. Overall, it was a pleasure to work
									on this website, be surrounded by the creations of local artists, and give
									back to this Dallas community.
